# RaysHotDogs
Learning Xamarin Android using PluralSight course by Gill Cleeren (excellent resource)

Note:  Didn't bothe to find some of the image files to make it look nice.
Didn't adjust the program to use internal memory on the phone (for the Take picture with ray option), so taht won't work
Didn't both to get a Google Map API key, so that won't work
I think the rest works

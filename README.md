# RaysHotDogs
Learning Xamarin Android using PluralSight course by Gill Cleeren (excellent resource)

Notes:  <br />
Didn't bother to find some of the image files to make it look nice.<br />
Didn't adjust the program to use internal memory on the phone (for the Take picture with ray option), so that won't work. <br />
Didn't bother to get a Google Map API key, so that won't work<br />

I think the rest works
